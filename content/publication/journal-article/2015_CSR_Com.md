abstract: This study analyzes the communication practice of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in Albania trying to actively endorse the engagement in social involvement, customer satisfaction, work environment, good reputation and environmental issues. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the trend of CSR communication by analyzing its content, identifying similarities and analyzing to what extent is CSR effectively communicated. We analyze two groups composed of 10 local and international companies operating in Albania. The results suggest that in spite of the existence of a high degree of similarity in the information released on CSR communication between Albanian and International corporations in two of the main dimensions of CSR there is a tangible difference between Albanian and International companies. International corporations place on prominent level all the dimensions of CSR, clearly expressing their commitment on issues, and devote more space to the description of information. Albanian companies, instead, are more focused on environment, society and economic dimensions, and present a common ground of information that is highly shared and misleads from their real commitment.
