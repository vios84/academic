abstract: There is a growing interest in understanding the communication patterns of companies ‘ social responsibility reports, not only for corporate governance prospective, but also from the linguistic point of view. A large body of evidences show that companies are conveying their CSR communication not only due to international standards of CSR (as Asset4 or GRI), but even to lower consumer skepticism, advertising and audience influence. Recently, CSR disclosures have increased exponentially worldwide. The communication of CSR combines informative and promotional purposes, data and reputation-building. Through a corpus-assisted discourse analysis of CSR reports issued Albanian companies, this study aims to explore the similarities of communication between companies from different industries. We classify CSR communication using Dahlsrud (2008) definition and use verbal markers of forward-looking statements, elements that communicate modality and authorial stance, in order to investigate the role of the CSR reports to the creation of an ethical image.
