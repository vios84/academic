<!--1 Certification %#certification

We are now pleased to be able to offer a certification programme. Certification
allows GATE users to demonstrate their competence to prospective employers, and
provides employers with a means of determining the level of GATE competency a
prospective employee has. It also offers an opportunity to consolidate your
knowledge after taking a training course and demonstrate your learning.

Each of the twelve GATE modules has an associated exam. Your certification level
depends on the number of modules you have passed:

- 3 modules = GATE Certified Text Analyst
- 6 modules = Advanced GATE Certified Text Analyst
- 9 modules = GATE Guru

A list of certified GATE Text Analysts can be found in the
%(https://gate.ac.uk/certified-developers.html, Hall of Fame)!

Current certification fees: 
- Students £75
- Academics £250
- Industrials £350

Exams can be taken on request in conjunction with training
events, or on an ad hoc basis in Sheffield, Sofia or Connecticut (or
elsewhere by arrangement). Please contact us at %(mailto:gate-fig@sheffield.ac.uk,
gate-fig@sheffield.ac.uk) for more information about certification.
