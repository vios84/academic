Hello! My name is *Visar Sylaj* and I am a linguist and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinology" target="_blank">sinologist</a>. I am currently pursuing a PhD in applied linguistics at <a href="http://english.snnu.edu.cn" target="_blank">Shaanxi Normal University</a> (SNNU). Prior to joining SNNU, I worked as head of communication and international office at the <a href="https://www.umed.edu.al" target="_blank">University of Medicine, Tirana</a>. I received my B.A. in Foreign Languages and M.A. (with hons.) in Linguistics from the <a href="https://www.unibo.it" target="_blank">University of Bologna</a>. I have participated in many research activities, including the Visiting Program for Young Sinologists held at Shaanxi Normal University in 2016 and at Zhengzhou University in 2017 and Beijing's prestigious forum for China Studies in 2017.
